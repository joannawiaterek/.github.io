Hi, this is Asia. I am a social anthropologist at heart interested in global development and global governance of AI. I have lots of questions about effective aid, innovation and inequality, and the impact of AI on the global order. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences. Now, I am doing Masters in International Social and Public Policy (Development) at LSE. In another life, I would probably be a theatre actress. I love cycling, playing squash, and learning foreign languages. Please, get in touch!
