Hi, this is Asia. I am a social anthropologist at heart, interested in global development, global governance of AI and equitable benefit-sharing. I have lots of questions about effective aid, innovation and inequality, and the impact of AI on the global order. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences. Currently, I am finishing my MSc in International Social and Public Policy (Development) at LSE. In another life, I would probably be a theatre actress. I love sports, building meaningful communities and learning foreign languages. Get in touch!
