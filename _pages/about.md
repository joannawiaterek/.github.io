Hi, this is Asia. I am a social anthropologist interested in global development, global governance of AI and benefit-sharing. I have lots of questions about effective aid, innovation and inequality, and the impact of AI on the global order. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences. Recently, I have finished my Masters at LSE where I wrote my dissertation on the inclusivity of the UN AI governance. Currently, I am co-founding the [Equiano Institute](https://www.equiano.institute/) where we research societal impacts of AI with a particular focus on developing countries. In a different life I would probably be a theatre actress. I love sports, bringing people together and learning foreign languages. Get in touch!
