title: New Global Governance Window: how the Global South can join the AI roundtable now.
date: 
description: My social policy essay exploring Sen's (1999) theory of development as freedom and Kingdon's (2011) multiple stream approach to policy-making. I discuss the urgency of the Global South seizing the “AI moment” and securing its seats at the AI roundtable. Written as part of my MSc in International Social and Public Policy (Development) at LSE (2023/2024).
