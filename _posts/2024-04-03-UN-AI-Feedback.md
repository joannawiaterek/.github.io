A few things to note:
1. Together with Emma L., we decided to learn more about the global AI governance landscape to understand better its effects on the global poor. We formed a question that would guide our research: "How can the Global South AI governance initiatives inform the “inclusivity” of the UN AI Advisory Body recommendations on global governance of AI?"
2. We are both quite new to the field of AI governance and come from the IR, social policy backgrounds, so we saw this very much as a learning opportunity.
3. Our aim was to understand better the national AI strategies and visions across the Global South regions, and to identify areas where the UN vision for AI governance neglects their interests.
4. Big thanks to Elliot for always being keen to answer any questions and provide guidanace in our research. Really appreciate it!
5. We only spent a month on this before submitting the feedback (on the last day!) but we thought of it as a good goal to have. We are now hoping to continue with a more in-depth research.
6. The word-limit for the submission was only 3000 characters.

### Feedback

To realise the core guiding principle of inclusivity, the UN report should draw more closely on the AI priorities and challenges outlined in the national AI strategies and multinational AI governance declarations across the Global South countries. In [“Missing Links in AI Governance”](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384787) published by UNESCO and Mila in 2023, Marie-Therese Png argues that one of the key prerequisites to effective inclusive AI governance is understanding the Global South AI discourse.

In February, we began conducting a [shallow review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gcAZhyW9_btQDEvjns9INmqK1wzR3zp6EAtJAn-9YFA/edit?usp=sharing) of over 60 Global South AI governance initiatives. We recognise, however, that further initiatives should consider voices from civil society groups as well.

##### Be more specific by drawing upon AI goals that Global South countries have set for themselves!

So far, there seems to be nothing “new” in the interim report. The current AI governance space is saturated beyond the nine initiatives mentioned on pages 14-15 and it would be worthwhile to acknowledge their diverse priorities within official UN recommendations. E.g. Mauritius has set an advanced goal to harness AI to enhance biotechnology and develop its Ocean Economy. Actual inclusivity should accommodate the different approaches to AI enhancement and regulation. 

##### Be more ambitious with goals and timelines. 

Most countries under our review have ambitions of being global leaders or regional AI hubs. E.g. Rwanda aims to become a global innovator for responsible and inclusive AI while India aims to leverage AI for inclusive growth, climate leadership and serving as a “garage” for other developing economies. UN recommendations should match the ambitions of the national AI strategies and outline a productive AI governance ecosystem that will support the Global South countries in leveraging their comparative advantages relative to their desired types of AI. 

##### Respond to the specific challenges faced by Global South countries in harnessing AI

Developing countries face resource constraints and lack the necessary infrastructure to harness their full AI potential. Some examples include: 
1. India: high resource cost and low awareness for adoption of AI.
2. Rwanda: lack of real bargaining power on the global fora.
3. Philippines: lack of sufficient funding to invest in AI talent and start-up ecosystems.
UN bodies should consider prioritising the removal of such barriers to ensure equitable access to AI benefits, foster international AI talent development and form a productively regulated ecosystem for open-source AI models.

##### Support coalition-building!

One way to increase inclusion of the underrepresented demands is for the Global South actors to magnify their bargaining power. The UN should harness its role as an international facilitator to identify and help form the potentially unexpected, yet highly impactful AI coalitions both across the Global South regions and across the Global North-South divide.
