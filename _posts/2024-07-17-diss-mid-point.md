### I have a topic!

I was very undecided about my dissertation topic. I was overwhelmed by the number of potential questions I was interested in, and their scope (see ‘Global Governance of AI: preliminary questions’). I struggled to be specific; I didn’t know much about AI, so I was quite stressed. But…

On the 2nd of June, I finally came up with a research question and a topic: I am doing a (discourse) analysis of the ‘Interim Report: Governing AI for Humanity’ to critique the UN's efforts and capabilities to ‘inclusively’ govern AI. This draws on two of my previous projects I have done this year.

While deciding on a question seemed a little bit like an epiphany, it was in fact a culmination of months of reading and chatting to friends.

What helped me to narrow down the question?

1. Previous projects.
- [my first essay on AI](https://joannawiaterek.github.io/blog/2024/New-Global-Governance-Window/) (which I would write differently now, but this was part of the learning process!)
- [research group on the Global South & AI governance](https://joannawiaterek.github.io/blog/2024/UN-AI-Feedback/) (again, an imperfect part of a learning process, yet one that allowed me to meet amazing people working on AI and research things I might draw on in my diss)

2. Resources.
- [The Africa Hour Podcast](https://afripoli.org/podcasts/)
- [‘AI Needs You’ by V. Harding (2024)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691244877/ai-needs-you)

3. Chats at the EAG conference in London (May/June), especially with [Observatorio de Riesgos Catastróficos Globales](https://www.orcg.info/).

4. Friends. Our conversations have been of immense value (and fun!), thank you!
- Rudolf, I owe you my life (again)! Thank you for your continuous feedback and the excitement to discuss (often crazy or unsound) ideas!
- Jerome, thank you for all the challenging thoughts and encouragement!
- Ketana, thank you for being an inspiration!

### I have some ideas!

Some ideas I want to explore:

- AI governance is a social and public policy issue, as well as a developmental issue.
- What is ‘inclusivity’? Of whom and to do what?
- How ‘inclusive’ has the report writing been so far?
- The UN must reform and deploy its comparative advantages if it wants to (1) play a role in governing AI and (2) stay a legitimate and relevant actor in international governance.
- There are solid lessons to be drawn from outer-space governance for governing AI: from its discourse of benefiting the “(hu)mankind”, the issue of the growing number of private actors involved in outer-space activities, multistakeholder governance, and more.
- The ‘human-like intelligence’ of AI, protection from AI risks/biases/... and global commons.
- End-beneficiaries of AI and ‘inclusivity’ in the design of AI governance.

### I am loving it!

I am so loving this time of research, thinking, making links between topics and having awesome chats with people about the diss! (The process is great, the writing is scary!)

### Key reflection:

How to choose a thesis question? Before deciding on a topic, I knew that the direction I’d follow would be crucial for allowing me to connect with organisations, and researchers, and ultimately, help me enter a career in AI governance. My priority was to upskill, meet interesting people, and as a result, allow me to shift towards a cause I consider really pressing: equitable benefit-sharing from AI, focused especially on eliminating global poverty.

I did take a little risk by pursuing this topic because no one in my department seemed excited about AI governance and I pushed against my assigned supervisor who said: “At the end of the day, your question needs to be ‘good enough’.”

I don’t think you should settle on something ‘good enough’. I think you should take ownership of your instincts and ideas, even if this is merely a Master’s thesis! When I spoke to Caleb Watney from the Institute for Progress at a conference last May, he gave me a really challenging piece of advice as he emphasised the value of focusing on something very narrow and pursuing it to signal that I can in fact independently choose a narrow problem and work on it.

Now, I agree that finding a niche may empower you to work really hard on something and get you easier access to other people in related fields. Yet, pursuing that niche often feels lonely, and standing behind your ideas against the world that encourages you to be just ‘good enough’ is possibly even more difficult than finding the niche in the first place! Getting the balance right between following your vision and learning from feedback is quite a skill, as you want to be an ‘ambitious’ visionary, but not a ‘blind’ visionary.

Midway through, I am really happy about the topic, as I am learning a lot, and I am so happy about the conversations it facilitated!

There are things I could have done better (e.g. read more, be more pro-active about attending relevant events, etc.) and I will reflect on them to learn my lessons, but I have also simply enjoyed my time in London over the past months and all the wonderful memories I got to make with my lovely friends!
