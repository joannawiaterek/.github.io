Just wanted to write a brief note on a prompt that a friend asked me over the weekend: 'What do you wish people in the [Christians for Impact](https://linktr.ee/effectivealtruismforchristians) community did more of?'

At first, I thought I'd have to think a long time about this, but then something pretty obvious came up to my mind: I simply wish we were all more entrepreneurial.

Entrepreneurial, brave and joyful.

I wish we said yes to projects and new opportunities more often.
I wish we created these opportunities ourselves in the first place.
I wish we were more of problem-solvers and risk-takers.
I wish we were leaders in our communities and workplaces.

I think the answer seemed obvious to me because this is in fact something I wish I was more like myself (working on this!).

I think there is something beautiful about the intersection of having firm foundations in our Christian faith and the call to stewardship, and at the same time, being driven, impact-oriented and looking for tools, and ways in which we can do the most good with the resources we have, with the energy we have, and the love that we have in our hearts.

And I really hope that this community of Christians for Impact that we are building is a safe space to do this: a space where we feel the support of people around us, so that we can take those risks; so that we can say that difficult yes to new projects; so that we can be creative and discuss all ideas, including those that are crazy, unrealistic or simply bad, with people who are on the same wavelength and will challenge us further.

Ultimately, working on the big issues that our world is facing is a common task and we can all contribute our own bit, but we can't solve it all on our own. Being in a community like this, and being empowered by a community like this, is also understanding that we are a team: each having different roles, yet united by a shared purpose. 

Lastly, we should always remember to remain humble, but humbleness and entrepreneurship don't have to be mutually exclusive. I think there can be something really powerful about practicing them alongside each other.

Given the vagueness of this note, I wanted to give examples of some entrepreneurial things I had in mind:
•	setting up new high-impact initiatives to address neglected issues
•	deciding to (radically) increase our monthly giving and shift towards much more frugal lifestyle
•	writing blogs, newsletters
•	making (nerdy but fun) impact-oriented things to our everyday life (e.g. carbon offsetting, creating apps for e.g. measuring our energy use).
