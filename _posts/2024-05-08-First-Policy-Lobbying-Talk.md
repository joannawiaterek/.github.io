On 1st May I gave a short pitch at the Newspeak House in London about why policy might be a high-impact career path, my experience from working at a foreign aid policy non-profit (~starting a think tank out of nothing!; in the UK) and I also shared some personal reflections. I thought I’d write down dome things from it:
1. I really believe in the power of policy. I think that policy can advance virtually every cause. However, I also think that it cannot advance all causes with equal efficiency at all times. Some policies are easier to change than others due to factors like political support and traction, policy windows or connections.
2. I haven’t considered foreign aid policy until September 2022 when I went to a conference that changed my life. I first listened to Jan-Willem’s talk from Training for Good on why you should work in policy. And it all made sense to me. My skillset matched some of the described roles and I generally felt super excited about it. A few hours later, I met one of the co-founders, and here we are!
3. As a young policy lobbying organisation, the key question to ask was about our comparative advantage: region, thematic focus, campaign methods, etc. I think we’re quite good at the culture of learning and evaluation, which is especially important at the beginning. We’re also quite agile and creative. If you’re a new organisation, you got to find smart avenues for getting things done.
4. There are of course also limitations to the organisation: we have no established authority yet, we’re no insiders to the political systems countries we want to work in, and aid effectiveness is not a popular cause currently.
5. The aid ecosystem is really busy. There are lots of actors all shaping aid policy in one way or another. Learning how to navigate that space is really important, as well as identifying key collaborators, unobvious decision-makers to talk to and understanding how the policy process actually works in a specific country. As an outsider, it can take some time to gather this information.
6. Generally, the information flow is a problem as well. As outsiders, it is hard to access all crucial info as soon as things happen, or even before they do.
7. Key bottleneck: politics. Aid has very low traction. The soft power rhetoric is much more popular among the politicians. There is also low public support for aid, thus, few incentives for the politicians to prioritise increasing aid quality.
8. There are narrow and few policy windows in aid, but some regions seem to be influenced faster than others. But this, you learn as you go, and probably differs based on a case you advocate for.
9. Befriend a decision-maker: your ideas might be great, but at the end of the day, you need internal support from the government to realise these ideas. Learning how to build that support and how to propose things to politicians is an incredibly valuable skill.
10. Policy work is great for career capital and learning about the decision-making ecosystem. It has helped me update my theory of change.
11. I recommend Kingdon’s work on policy-making.

I was super stressed before the event because I didn’t think I had anything relevant to say really, but now, I really appreciate the preparation time as it made me reflect about my work and lessons learnt!
