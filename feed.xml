I am a social anthropologist interested in global development and governance of AI. More specifically, I have lots of questions about effective aid, innovation and inequality, and the impact of AI on the global order. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences. Now, I am doing Masters in International Social and Public Policy (Development) at LSE. In a different life I would probably be a theatre actress. I love sports, cooking and learning foreign languages. Please, get in touch!&gt;</subtitle></feed>
