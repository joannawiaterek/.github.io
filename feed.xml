I am interested in global governance of AI, effective aid, innovation and inequality, and the impact of AI on the global order. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences, so I am a social anthropologist at heart. Now, I am pursuing Masters in International Social and Public Policy (Development) at LSE. In a different life I would probably be a theatre actress. I love sports, cooking and learning foreign languages. Please, get in touch! &gt;</subtitle></feed>
